# Genre
This is something that needs to be define throughout this project.

Two important definitions that are needed, in relation to genre:
1. Define what "is" genre
2. In what way is the "Western" genre interesting?
    a. Interresting in and of itself
    b. Interresting in relation to machine learning

## Societial conversation
David Thorburn discusses the way in which genre is *repetition* that establishes a norm, as well as variation from these established norms that evolve what he calls a social "conversation". It allows the conversation to continue, but also to evolve. He also mentions how genre is "infinite".
